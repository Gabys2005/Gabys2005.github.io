				<h2>Download</h2>
				<hr />
				<p>
					Click the button below to get redirected to Roblox's library page. Take the asset from there and use
					the Toolbox in Studio to insert it into your game. Every panel has a "Settings" script inside of it,
					make sure to check it out.
				</p>
				<div class="buttons">

				<h2>The A and B group split</h2>
				<hr />
				<p>
					A GLights panel can control 2 separate groups of lights at once to reduce the amount of panels
					needed for less used lights. Both groups share the same settings. You can specify which light
					folders are assigned to which group by changing the "Lights" setting (see below). You can enable or
					disable the A and B groups by clicking the A and B buttons below the color selection
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="step">
				<h2>Adding more light folders to a panel</h2>
				<hr />
				<ol>
					<li>Open the Settings script in that panel</li>
					<li>
						Add more folder paths to the appropriate Lights setting. For example if you want the A group to
						control the "Beams1" and "Beams2" folders then the setting would look similar to this:
					</li>
				</ol>
				<pre><code class="language-lua">
A = { script.Parent.Parent.Beams1, script.Parent.Parent.Beams2 }
					</code></pre>
			</div>

			<div class="step">
				<h2>Adding more panels</h2>
				<hr />
				<ol>
					<li>Duplicate one of the panels</li>
					<li>Open its "Settings" script and edit the Lights setting to include the new light folders</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					⚠️ Duplicating the entire GLights folder is technically possible, but it's not advised. There should
					only be 1 folder with GLights scripts in your game (unless you're making a prop, check below)
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="step">
				<h2>Using GLights in a prop</h2>
				<hr />
				<p>
					Make sure that the "ClientSided" setting on all panels is set to false and that you're using your
					own folder with scripts. Other than that nothing special needs to be done
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="step">
				<h2>Using GLights with StacyPilot</h2>
				<hr />
				<p>
					You can install the official StacyPilot addon for GLights from the StacyPilot plugin or
					<a href="https://gist.github.com/Gabys2005/8db2bd70698339cbb8a75aee6ffb79c6" target="_blank">
						here </a
					>. Make sure all panels have their "UniqueName" setting set to something different so StacyPilot can
					differentiate between them
				</p>
				<p>
					⚠️ Please note that the addon does <b>not</b> save starting state, which means that it doesn't know
					what happened before the recording (the color of the lights, etc.). Make sure that they're in the
					same state when you start recording and replaying. The easiest way to do that would be to right
					click the Reset button on all panels.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="step">
				<h2>Questions / GLights don't work</h2>
				<hr />
				<p>
					You can DM me on Discord: <span class="code">.gabys</span> with any questions you might have. Please
					tell me the version of the GLights you're using (it's visible on the panels)
				</p>
				<p>
					If the GLights do not work at all then make sure to check the Output window (<span class="code">
						View -> Output
					</span>
					in Studio after running the game) for any errors, and send them to me if there are any
				</p>
