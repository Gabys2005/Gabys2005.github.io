					You can have infinite lights per panel, as well as infitite groups ("Fix2" the group is 2, etc.).<br />
					Each panel can control 2 separate groups of lights (of the same type).<br />
					At this point in time the "Circle" cue is not implemented, I'll make it work soon.<br />
					If you're planning to use the lights in a prop then make sure the "ClientSided" setting is set to
					false<br />
					I'm not gonna write out what every button does, just go experiment with the lights. A better
					explanation of everything will hopefully come soon™️. If you have any questions you can DM me on
					Discord Gabys2005#1691

					The code is split into 3 folders: "Core", "Cues" and "DefaultPanels".<br />
					The "Core" folder contains code that performs the basic tasks, like On, Off, Color, etc. It's
					required for the lights to work<br />
					The "Cues" and "DefaultPanels" folders contain code for the cues and panels bundled with the lights,
					they're not necessary for the lights to function.
